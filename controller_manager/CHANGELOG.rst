0.7.2 (2014-04-01)
------------------

------------------

0.7.0 (2014-03-28)
------------------
* Add --timeout option to controller spawner
* Use argparse instead of getopt
  It is a much nicer interface
* Contributors: Paul Mathieu

0.6.0 (2014-02-05)
------------------
* Update controller_manager.cpp
  Postfix to prefix increment operator.
* Contributors: Adolfo Rodriguez Tsouroukdissian

0.5.8 (2013-10-11)
------------------
* Fixed additional timeout that was just added
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into extended_wait_time
* Extended wait time to 30 seconds for slower computers
* Renamed manifest.xml to prevent conflicts with rosdep
* Fix broken unspawner script.
* Check controller_manager API early. Fast shutdown.
  - Check for all services required by spawner at the beginning, so it can know
  early on that it has all its requisites.
  - Remove service waiting from shutdown to ensure a fast teardown.
  Usecase: A spawner that dies after the controller manager should not wait
  for services to appear as they will never appear, the controllers are already
  stopped. This happens for example when killing a Gazebo session.
* Restore controller stop+unload on node kill.
  - Fixes `#111 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/issues/111>`_.

0.5.7 (2013-07-30)
------------------
* Update controller_manager.cpp
  getControllerNames now clears names before adding current names.  This fixes a bug in reloadControllerLibrariesSrv where the method is called twice in a row without first clearing the list.
  Steps to reproduce:
  - Spawn controller
  - Stop controller
  - reload-libraries
  controller_manager.cpp:501: bool controller_manager::ControllerManager::reloadControllerLibrariesSrv(controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Request&, controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Response&): Assertion `controllers.empty()' failed.
