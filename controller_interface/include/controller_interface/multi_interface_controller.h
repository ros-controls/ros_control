/**
 * \brief %Controller able to claim resources from multiple hardware interfaces.
 *
 * This particular controller implementation allows to claim resources from one
 * up to four different hardware interfaces. The types of these hardware
 * interfaces are specified as template parameters.
 *
 * An example multi-interface controller could claim, for instance, resources
 * from a position-controlled arm and velocity-controlled wheels. Another
 * example would be a controller claiming both position and effort interfaces
 * for the same robot resources, but this would require a robot with a custom
 * (non-exclusive) resource handling policy.
 *
 * By default, all specified hardware interfaces are required, and their
 * existence will be enforced by \ref initRequest. It is possible to make hardware
 * interfaces optional by means of the \c allow_optional_interfaces
 * \ref MultiInterfaceController::MultiInterfaceController "constructor" parameter.
 * This allows to write controllers where some interfaces are mandatory, and
 * others, if present, improve controller performance, but whose absence does not
 * prevent the controller from running.
 *
 * The following is an example of a controller claiming resources from velocity-
 * and effort-controlled joints.
 *
 * \code
 * #include <controller_interface/multi_interface_controller.h>
 * #include <hardware_interface/joint_command_interface.h>
 *
 * using namespace hardware_interface;
 * class VelEffController : public
 *       controller_interface::MultiInterfaceController<VelocityJointInterface,
 *                                                      EffortJointInterface>
 * {
 * public:
 *   VelEffController() {}
 *
 *   bool init(hardware_interface::RobotHW* robot_hw, ros::NodeHandle &n)
 *   {
 *     // robot_hw pointer only contains the two interfaces requested by the
 *     // controller. It is a subset of the entire robot, which may have more
 *     // hardware interfaces
 *
 *     // v and e below are guarranteed to be valid
 *     VelocityJointInterface* v = robot_hw->get<VelocityJointInterface>();
 *     EffortJointInterface*   e = robot_hw->get<EffortJointInterface>();
 *
 *     // Fetch resources from interfaces, perform rest of initialization
 *     //...
 *
 *     return true;
 *   }
 *   void starting(const ros::Time& time);
 *   void update(const ros::Time& time, const ros::Duration& period);
 *   void stopping(const ros::Time& time);
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * The following fragment is a modified version of the above example, where
 * controller interfaces are not required. It is left to the controller
 * implementer to verify interface validity. Only the initialization code is
 * shown.
 *
 * \code
 * class VelEffController : public
 *       controller_interface::MultiInterfaceController<VelocityJointInterface,
 *                                                      EffortJointInterface>
 * {
 * public:
 *   // Note true flag passed to parent class, allowing requested hardware
 *   // interfaces to be optional
 *   VelEffController()
 *    : controller_interface::MultiInterfaceController<VelocityJointInterface,
 *                                                     EffortJointInterface> (true)
 *   {}
 *
 *   bool init(hardware_interface::RobotHW* robot_hw, ros::NodeHandle &n)
 *   {
 *     // robot_hw pointer contains at most the two interfaces requested by the
 *     // controller. It may have none, only one or both, depending on whether the
 *     // robot exposes them
 *
 *     // v is a required interface
 *     VelocityJointInterface* v = robot_hw->get<VelocityJointInterface>();
 *     if (!v)
 *     {
 *       return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     // e is an optional interface. If present, additional features are enabled.
 *     // Controller can still function if interface or some of its resources are
 *     // absent
 *     EffortJointInterface* e = robot_hw->get<EffortJointInterface>();
 *
 *     // Fetch resources from interfaces, perform rest of initialization
 *     //...
 *
 *     return true;
 *   }
 *   ...
 * };
 * \endcode
